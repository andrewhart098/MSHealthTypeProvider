An F# type provider for the Microsoft Health API.

The Microsoft Health API integrates the data you collect off your Microsoft band and let's you access that data (for free!) using their REST based API that uses OAuth2 for authorization.

You can interactivily explore the endpoints for the Microsoft Health API here: https://developer.microsoftband.com/cloudAPI/Explorer

By using this project you get access to a typed domain model that mirrors the MS Health API endpoints and calls the endpoints for you.  However, you must pass the Bearer token into the functions to get access to the appropriate data from the API.

Examples coming soon.
